# WordLens

## Inspiration
I love reading books. It helps me think better and understand other people's feelings. I learned that some people have a hard time reading because of dyslexia, and I wanted to help. So I made WordLens AR, an app to help people with dyslexia read and write more easily and to help everyone get the same chance to learn in school.

## What it does
WordLens is an app for iPhones that helps people with dyslexia. Dyslexia makes reading, writing, and spelling hard for some people. It's not about being smart; it's just how their brains work.

The app has a simple design with pictures and voice commands so it's easy to use. It uses the phone's camera to help in three ways:

1. **Reading:** You can point your camera at words you want to read. The app will make the words bigger and read them out loud to you. There's also an option to see a 3D picture of the word on the screen to understand it better.

2. **Writing:** If you have trouble spelling a word, the app helps you. Just write on paper, scan it with the camera, and the app will show you the right spelling. Then it projects the correct word on the paper so you can trace it.

3. **Tracking Progress:** The app keeps track of the words you find tricky and shows how much you're improving over time. This information is kept safe and private.

The goal of WordLens is to make reading and writing easier for people with dyslexia so they can get better at it.

## How we built it
I used tools like XCode and Swift (which are for making iPhone apps) to create WordLens. The app has a simple look with animations, and it uses special technology to show 3D images from a service called echo3D. I made sure everything in the app is easy to read and understand.

I also made a smart system that can look at the words you write and figure out what you mean, even if there are mistakes. This helps the app suggest the right spelling.

To design the way the app looks, I used a tool called Figma. Then I made those designs real using XCode.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to show 3D images in the app was hard, but I kept trying until I got it right. Making the spelling helper work well was also tough, but I solved it by trying different things.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I made an app that really helps people. I used some cool technology like 3D images and a smart system that understands writing to make a helpful app. This project taught me a lot, even more than I learned from school or online videos.

## What we learned
Using technology to help people is important. I learned a lot about how to make an app that can make a big difference in people's lives.

## What's next for WordLens
I want to make the app even better and put it in the App Store so everyone can use it. I also hope to work with doctors to see how much it can help people with dyslexia.
